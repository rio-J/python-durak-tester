# python-durak-tester
For testing a command-line version of the card game Durak in Python 3.

Allows single or bulk testing. Manually select a normal test or a verbose test (where every play is printed, and every step through the code logged), then select the number of tests to run. Offers a summary at the end. Automatically forfeits a game that has gone on too long.
